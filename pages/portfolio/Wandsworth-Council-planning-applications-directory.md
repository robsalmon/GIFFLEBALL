pageTitle: Wandsworth Council planning applications directory
intro: I developed a directory of weekly advertised planning applications for Wandsworth Council's planning department in April 2013.
---
The directory shows the planning applications received that the council are required to advertise by law. The applications are displayed for the past month by week ending and include links to details of each planning application in the council's planning explorer.
